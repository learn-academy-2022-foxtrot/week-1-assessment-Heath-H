# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. If you don't know the answer a good tip is to answer a simpler version of the question.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

Your answer: logical operators?

Researched answer: loose equality operators (comparing one value to another to see if they equal the same thing ex true == false the outcome is false, 3 == "3" the outcome is true), relational operators which look for a relationship between two values (ex: 4 < 10 output = true), and logical operators where at least one side of the equation has to be true.

Researched answer: arrays and strings are similar because arrays can list individual values in "", and strings must be contained in "". they are different because arrys use [], while strings use (). And arrays are used for indexed lists, while strings are used to make statements. 

5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

Your answer: In proper pair programming, the "driver"" will be the person to type the code, while the "navigator" is the person to instruct the driver on what to type.

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

2. Jest: a javascript testing framework made up of dependancies (a collection of files)

3. Objects: a collection of related data and/or functionality

4. Method: when a function belongs to an object

5. Classes: a type of function that contain data and behavior, they are like blueprints
