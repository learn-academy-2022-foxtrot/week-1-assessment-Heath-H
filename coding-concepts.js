// ASSESSMENT 1: Coding Conceptual Questions

// Examine the following examples.

// First, predict the outcome based on your understanding of the code.
// Then, uncomment the console.log() and verify the output. Briefly explain why your initial answer was correct or incorrect.

// --------------------INSTRUCTOR EXAMPLE: What will this log?
//const colors = ["tangerine", "magenta", "lilac", "daffodil"]
// console.log(colors.push("indigo"))

// a) Your answer:
// b) Verify and explain:


// --------------------1) What will this log?

// const cohort = "LEARN 2022"
// console.log(cohort.length)

// a) Your answer: i believe this will determine the length of "LEARN 2022"
// b) Verify and explain: i was correct, the outcome was the length of 10. this is because .length returns the numer of elements in an array


// // --------------------2) What will this log?

// const greeting = "Hello World!"
// console.log(greeting[4])

// // a) Your answer: i believe this will give the outcome of "o" since that is the index of [4]
// // b) Verify and explain: i was correct, this is because bracket notations allow us to access elements by index


// // --------------------3) What will this log?

// const languages = ["JavaScript", "Ruby", "Python", "C++"]
// const index = 1
// console.log(languages[index])

// // a) Your answer: i believe the outcome will be Ruby, considering Ruby is in the first index
// // b) Verify and explain: i was correct. if you set const index to 0, 1, 2, or 3 the outcome will be whatever value is in that index


// // --------------------4) What will this log?

// const weekendDays = ["saturday", "sunday"]
// console.log(weekendDays.toUpperCase())

// // a) Your answer: i beleieve .toUpperCase will return the words in all uppercase letters
// // b) Verify and explain: i recieved an error message because "toUpperCase" is not a function


// // --------------------5) What will this log?

// const dataTypes = ["number", "string", "Boolean"]
// console.log(dataTypes.length)

// // a) Your answer: this will return the length of this array. 20
// // b) Verify and explain: the outcome was "number" the original console.log(type of datatTypes.length) returned the word "number". i took out "typeOf" (assuming it was a typo, maybe from me) and the outcome was "3". this is the number of elements in the array. so .length returns the number of elements, not the number of individula letters.
